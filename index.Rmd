### Welcome!

This is the accompanying website for our book **_Modelling Spatial and Spatial-Temporal Data: A Bayesian approach_**. Here we provide the datasets and the code so that the reader can perform the analyses featured in the book.

<br />

### Highlights of the book:

* The book is aimed at statisticians and quantitative social, economic and public health students and researchers who work with small area spatial and spatial-temporal data; 

* The book compares both hierarchical and spatial econometric modelling, providing both a reference and a teaching text with exercises in each chapter.

* The book provides a fully Bayesian, self-contained, treatment of the underlying statistical theory, with chapters dedicated to substantive applications.

<br />

### <a href="chapters.html" style="color:rgb(105 147 236)">Contents</a>:

* Part I covers fundamental issues arising when modelling small area spatial and spatial-temporal data.

* Part II focuses on modelling cross-sectional spatial data.

* Part III discusses modelling spatial-temporal data.

* Part IV suggests some future directions and challenges in modelling spatial and spatial-temporal data.

<font size=5>"*This well-written book is a good source for the Bayesian concepts and methods to practice the spatial-temporal analysis using R and WinBugs codes. [...] I recommend this book to economics, health, statistics and computing professionals and researchers.*"</font><font size=4> --- Ramalingam Shanmugam, Texas State University (Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation)</font>
